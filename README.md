# etch-a-sketch

A web-based etch-a-sketch project, made in Javascript, HTML and CSS for The Odin Project's foundations. 

This was fun to build, although I felt shouldn't have spent quite so much time at first making it _look nice_, before I'd actually got the dynamic grid and it's functions working. That said, I felt a lot of the flex / CSS stuff I'd been learning start to make more sense (although I am planning to refactor this at some point once we get onto mobile as it only really looks okay on a full screen browser). I also found myself using git in a much more natural way, building it into the way I worked on the project.
